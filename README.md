# Ensemble-learning-ISO-27001
Ensemble learning for improving accuracy and then applying ISO Standards to do care about attacks.
In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives. 



## ISO 27005 (Risk Mnagement)
ISO/IEC 27005 "Information technology — Security techniques — Information security risk management" is an international standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) providing good practice guidance on managing risks to information. It is a core part of the ISO/IEC 27000-series of standards, commonly known as ISO27k. 

ISO/IEC 27005 does not specify or recommend specific risk management methods in detail. Instead it discusses the process in more general/overall terms, drawing on the generic risk management method described by ISO 31000:


    Identify and assess the risks;
    Decide what to do about the risks
    Monitor the risks, risk treatments etc., identifying and responding appropriately to significant changes, issues/concerns or opportunities for improvement;
    Keep stakeholders (principally the organization's management) informed throughout the process.
