# Machine-learning-ISO-27001
Ensemble learning for improving accuracy and then applying ISO Standards to do care about attacks.
In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives. 



## ISO/IEC 27001(Information security management systems)
The ISO 27001 framework is renowned for its comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, focusing on prevention and thorough risk assessment. It advocates protecting information assets and reducing vulnerabilities. In line with ISO 27001 principles, this international paper introduces a cautious security method utilizing two classifiers (RF and KNN) to identify potential attacks. The objective is to achieve a zero successful attack rate, reinforcing security by proactively addressing risks. This approach bolsters system resilience and diminishes susceptibility to successful attacks, thereby advancing comprehensive security.
